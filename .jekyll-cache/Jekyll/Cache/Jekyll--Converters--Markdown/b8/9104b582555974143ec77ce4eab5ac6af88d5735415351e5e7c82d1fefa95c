<!-- just type out the text without html -->
<p>Having different modalities on the same network is something that has already been implemented before. However, modalities that I am refering to are regular cars, bicycles, public transportation, etc.</p>

<p>The question is how to create a network that contains regular vehicles mixed with ride-sharing vehicles (taxis). In my current research, I am trying to implement Peaguâ€™s example where the network will contain
a mixed traffic of regular vehicles with ride-sharing vehicles. The code for this example can be found <a href="https://github.com/NikolaAndro/MATSim">here</a>.</p>

<p>This implementation is still in process. Current issue is that regular vehicles and ride-sharing vehicles do not use the same dtd (Document Type Description) files. Regular vehicles use plans_v4.dtd for plans file. 
On the other hand, I am not sure what would ride-sharing vehicles use.</p>
