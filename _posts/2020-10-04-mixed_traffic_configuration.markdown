<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">C</span>onfiguring mixed traffic in MATSim is not a very popular topic. Hence, here I will be posting updates on mixed traffic configuration.

As we can already see from other examples from MATSim researchers, in order to have a ride-sharing vehicles network, we have to enter that module in our config file. For instance, in Pegou's example that I am 
implementing, that configuration looks something like this:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
