	<p class="intro"><a href="https://www.matsim.org/">MATSim (Multi-Agent Transport Simulator)</a> is a platform used for simulating real-world transportation scenarios.</p>
	<p>The MATSim project (MATSim, 2016) started with <b>Kai Nagel</b>at <b>ETH Zurich</b> and his interest in improving his work with, and for, the TRANSIMS (TRansportation ANalysis and SIMulation System) project; he also wanted to make the resulting code opensource. After Kai Nagel’s departure to Berlin in 2004, <b>Kay W. Axhausen</b> joined the team, bringing a dierent approach and experience.</p>
	<h2>Brief Introduction</h2>
	<p>"MATSim is an activity-based, extendable, multi-agent simulation framework implemented in Java. It is open-source and can be downloaded from the Internet. The framework is designed for large-scale scenarios, meaning that all models’ features are stripped down to efficiently handle the targeted functionality; parallelization has also been very important. For the network loading simulation, for example, a queue-based model is implemented, omitting very complex and computationally expensive car-following behavior."<i> (Kai Nagel, Kay W. Axhausen, Andreas Horni)</i></p>
